DATA DICTIONARY - CODE BOOK FOR DATA SUBMITTED TO GETTING AND CLEANING DATA COURSE PROJECT

This document describes the data that has been submitted as part of the project work for the Getting and Clenaing Data Course.

The tidadata.txt file attached can be read into R using the following command:
tbl_read <- read.table("TidyData.txt", header = TRUE)

The final output of the project has 4 columns 

Column1: 
subject_id: This column unique identifies 1 of the 30 subjects that participated in the experiment

Column2 : 
activity_name: This column names 1 of the 6 activities(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) that have been used to calculate stats in the experiment.

Columns 3 - Columns 66: 
These column has the average value of the variable for the activity performed by the subject from the training and testing data,ie, it has the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. The column headers provide the name of the variable.

The variables in the data are:

For the purposes of this project, out of all the variables that was made available through the raw data, only the mean and standard deviation of each measure have been taken into consideration.

Please see the "Features_info.txt" from the raw data set refers to the original documentation describing all the features that were measured as part of the experiment.


The raw data that has been used to analyse in this project has come the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset(http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
