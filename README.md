# GettingAndCleaningDataProject
This repository has data and script used for the getting and cleaning data project on coursera

## run_analysis.R
This is the script that performs the analysis required to complete the project. The script is written to achieve the following objectives:
<li> Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
<li> Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
<li> Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
<li> Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
<li> From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The script assumes that the raw data required for the analysis has been downloaded and unzipped to a directory that has been set as the working directory from where the script will be run.
